title: Setup

In this course, we will be using the python programming language to solve E&M problems which are too difficult to solve by hand. As such, you will need a working installation of python on your computer. Setting up python on your computer is easy:

1. Go to the [anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and install the version appropriate for your operating system.
2. Open up anaconda and choose the jupyter notebook application.

Jupyter notebook is a convenient way to run code. Rather than typing everything into a text file and then running the text file through a terminal (for example, editting a file called `assignment.py` and then in the terminal running `python assignment.py`) one types code into cells and the code is run immediately. Note that jupyter notebook is not some esoteric way of running python code: it is commonly used in most scientific disciplines and you will likely be using it for some of your 3rd year courses and most of your 4th year courses.

There are a few things I highly recommend doing before coming to the tutorials and attempting the assignment problems.

1. Learn how to use jupyter notebook properly. See this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C9E2yPBw7s)
2. Learn the keyboard shortcuts of jupyter notebook. You can find them [here](http://maxmelnick.com/2016/04/19/python-beginner-tips-and-tricks.html)

The real power of the python programming language is the ability to use open-source, professional, mathematical/scientific code to solve problems. These are referred to as *packages* in python. Often times I will use packages in the tutorials that you may need to install. To install `numba`, for example, open up a terminal and type `pip install numba`.

I will provide you with lots of tips and tricks of programming throughout these tutorials, but ultimately, you need to make google your best friend. **Learn how to google the right kinds of questions**.
