Setting up python on your computer is easy:

1. Go to the [anaconda download page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and install the version appropriate for your operating system.
2. Open up anaconda and choose the jupyter notebook application.

Jupyter notebook is a convenient way to run code. Rather than typing everything into a text file and then running the text file through a terminal (for example, editting a file called `assignment.py` and then in the terminal running `python assignment.py`) one types code into cells and the code is run immediately. Note that jupyter notebook is not some esoteric way of running python code: it is commonly used in most scientific disciplines and you will likely be using it for some of your 3rd year courses and most of your 4th year courses.

The real power of the python programming language is the ability to use open-source, professional, mathematical/scientific code to solve problems. These are referred to as *packages* in python. Often times I will use packages in the tutorials that you may need to install. To install `numba`, for example, open up a terminal and type `pip install numba`.
