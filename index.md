Welcome to the tutorial webpage of PHYS 326. This page provides links to all problems we will solve throughout the tutorials. In this course, we will be using the python programming language to solve E&M problems which are too difficult to solve by hand. As such, you will need a working installation of python on your computer. I will provide you with lots of tips and tricks of programming throughout these tutorials, but ultimately, you need to make google your best friend. **Learn how to google the right kinds of questions**. 


> ## Prerequisites
> Please go through the setup and make sure you have all the required components installed on your computer. There are a few things I highly recommend doing before coming to the tutorials and attempting the assignment problems.
> 1. Learn how to use jupyter notebook properly. See this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3C9E2yPBw7s)
> 2. Learn the keyboard shortcuts of jupyter notebook. You can find them [here](http://maxmelnick.com/2016/04/19/python-beginner-tips-and-tricks.html)
