> Consider a current loop with current $I$ given by $z=0$, $x^2 + y^2 = a^2$ travelling in the standard counter-clockwise position in the $xy$ plane. 

# Part 1
> Plot $B_x$ and $B_y$ on the planes $z=-a/2$, $z=-a/4$, $z=a/4$ and $z=a/2$. Use a quiver plot. On the same axes, plot a heat plot of $B_z$. Based on the plot, are the results consistent with Griffiths Figure 5.55 for a "Physical" dipole?

# Part 2
> Make a streamplot of $B_x$ and $B_z$ in the plane $y=0$ for $x \in [-2a, 2a]$ and $z \in [-2a, 2a]$.
